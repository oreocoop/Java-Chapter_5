 *
 * Suzuki is a monk who climbs a large staircase to the monastery as part of a ritual. Some days he climbs more stairs
 * than others depending on the number of students he must train in the morning. He is curious how many stairs might be
 * climbed over the next 20 years and has spent a year marking down his daily progress.
 *
 * The sum of all the stairs logged in a year will be used for estimating the number he might climb in 20.
 *
 * 20_year_estimate = one_year_total * 20
 *
 * You will receive the following data structure representing the stairs Suzuki logged in a year. You will have all
 * data for the entire year so regardless of how it is logged the problem should be simple to solve.
 *
 * Your function should return the 20 year estimate of the stairs climbed using the formula above.
